#### Calculations
```javascript
// Trip Level
freight = distance Ã— ratePerKm
totalExpenses = sum(all expenses)
netProfit = earnings - totalExpenses

// Truck Level
remainingDebt = acquisitionCost - netProfit
isBreakEven = remainingDebt <= 0
roi = (netProfit / acquisitionCost) Ã— 100

// Fleet Level
totalFleetValue = sum(all truck acquisition costs)
totalFleetProfit = sum(all truck net profits)
averageROI = sum(all truck ROIs) / number of trucks
```
